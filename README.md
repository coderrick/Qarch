Qarch
=============================

This is a web-app that allows users to view their route given by Google maps in streetview form. This can be viewed immersively using Google cardboard, or simply on a PC. The application runs through the series of photos as a video which allows the user to get an idea of what their route looks like. This gives the user visual queues to remember their route, rather than solely relying on a map and written directions.
